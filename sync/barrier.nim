    ## A barrier is a synchronization mechanism that allows a set of threads to
    ## all wait for each other to reach a common point. Barriers are useful in
    ## programs involving a fixed-size party of cooperating threads that must
    ## occasionally wait for each other. The barrier is called a cyclic barrier
    ## if it can be reused after the waiting threads are released.
    ##
    ## The barrier is initialized for a given number of threads. Each thread
    ## that calls `wait` on the barrier will block until all the threads have
    ## made that call. At this point, the barrier is reset to its initial state
    ## and all threads are released.
    c: Cond
    L: Lock
    required: int # number of threads needed for the barrier to continue
    left: int # current barrier count, number of threads still needed.
    cycle: uint # generation count
